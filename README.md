This is a Simple Typing Simulator made in AutoHotKey used to emulate realistic typing to pass plagiarism checks within DraftBack
How to use:

1. Simply open the .exe
2. Paste your text
3. Click type it out

This script includes some features to emulate human typing to pass Draftback and version history checks within google docs for plagiarism   
Script Includes:

1. Realistic typing mistakes which are then backspaced and replaced with the correct text
2. Random variability between how quickly text is typed
3. 12-minute breaks for every 5000 characters 
(Draftback looks for how many times text has been typed without a 10 minute break, adding this for every 5000 characters makes it look more realistic when it types extremely long chunks of text) 

Here is an example of how it looks to a teacher viewing how an assignment was typed using this Script
