This script includes some features to emulate human typing to pass Draftback and version history checks within google docs for plagiarism
Script Includes
Realistic typing mistakes which are then backspaced and replaced with the correct text
Random variability between how quickly text is typed
12 minute breaks for every 5000 characters (Draftback looks for how many times text has been typed without a 10 minute break, adding this for every 5000 characters makes it look more realistic when it types extremely long chunks of text)
